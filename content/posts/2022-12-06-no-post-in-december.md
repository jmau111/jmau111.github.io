I won't publish new posts in December 2022 on this blog (hum, maybe except this one ü§î).

Why?
--------

I'll be busy elsewhere, but I have some ideas for 2023 \o/

What to expect in 2023
--------

Deeper analysis, but still with simple words üôèüèª.

Learned in 2022
--------

* CTFs (more than 70 days of practice, "g¬∞od" level unlocked on popular platforms)
* Kernel exploits on Linux
* LD exploits on Linux
* Bash deeply
* The OSI model and packet sniffing
* Volatility and memory analysis
* Advanced forensics and malware analysis

Personal thoughts on hacking
--------

I tend to prefer the Blue team, as it seems _a bit_ more challenging for me, but you can't skip [attacking techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) if you want to catch your adversaries.

In 2022, I've experimented "real-world" assignments, solved various CTFs, made some contributions, and wrote some blog posts. It's also pretty cool to be a software developer, as you can see the same problem from multiple angles:

* how anyone can be hacked despite what I would call "a decent level of awareness and even practical skills," which keeps you humble regardless of your efforts
* how developers fail to secure the code, but also how to fix critical vulnerabilities
* how to conduct basic forensics (Linux, Windows) and malware analysis
* how attackers divert native functionalities and exploit known flaws in popular operating systems
* how hard it can be for organizations to keep pace with security patches, especially against the less sophisticated but still devastating exploits
* how hard it is to be accurate while trying to tackle security topics with simple words
* how cool ethical hacking is and helps you understand what's possible and what's probably not (until someone manages to achieve it üòÇ)

However, I'm quite disappointed that some critical aspects are still underestimated by organizations, like having a security culture and regular pen-tests.

Many systems shift the responsibility to the end-users (e.g., employees). While a good security hygiene is necessary, it's not always enough. Even the "extreme mode" cannot save you sometimes, so you'd better prepare for post-exploitation and breaches instead of blaming on the tools or someone else.

Cheers

See you in 2023.
