I used to use the term "Ethical Hacking," but it sounds a bit vague for me now. Each individual seems to have his own approach. 

You'll quickly feel like Alice in _The Hall of Doors_.

Of course, all information shared on this blog is intended for **educational purposes only**. I take no responsibility for any illegal actions you might try using it.

Most bugs, vulnerabilities, exploits, and other demos out there are already documented, but maybe you'll like to learn hard concepts with simpler words.

I try to avoid inaccuracies, so if you find something wrong, please report it.
