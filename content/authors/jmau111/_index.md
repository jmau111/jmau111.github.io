Hello, I'm Julien. I've created this blog. It's mainly about hacking and my journey in cyber, but good contributions are welcome.

Love the following problem, can you solve it in 10s (or less)?

> A man goes to a bar, he sees 7 of his friends outside. They were waiting for him. They shake hands. How many handshakes does it make?

_N.B.: we assume his friends were waiting for him to start greeting._
